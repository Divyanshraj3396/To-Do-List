# To-Do List Project

This is a simple To-Do List application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.

## Features

- **Add a Task**: Users can type a task and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Users can click on a task to toggle its completion status, striking through the text.
- **Delete a Task**: Each task has a delete button that removes it from the list.

## Installation

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
